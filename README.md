This dataset provides three emission mitigation scenarios leading to the year 2050 for 420 urban areas. 
These urban areas take place among the 500 urban areas with the highest consumption based urban emissions footprint in 2015 according to Moran et al. (2018) and located across all world regions. The first two scenarios are based on trends according to the IMAGE SSP1-1.9 and IMAGE SSP1-2.6 context based on Gidden et al. (2019) while the third scenario is based on trends in a renewable energy scenario according to Bogdanov et al. (2021). All urban areas are harmonized across urban datasets and applied urban level population projections based on Kii (2021). Among the responsibility of urban areas in GHG emissions excluding aviation, shipping and biogenic emission sources, the top 420 urban areas are found to be responsible for a share of about 27%, representing about 10.8 GtCO2eq - 11.0 GtCO2eq of emissions in 2020 across the three scenarios. By 2030, the 420 urban areas would be responsible for about 7.0 GtCO2eq in SSP1-1.9, 10.5 GtCO2eq in SSP1-2.6 and 5.2 GtCO2eq in the SSP1-RE scenario. By mid-century, the same 420 urban areas would be responsible for about 1.1 GtCO2eq in SSP1-1.9, 6.6 GtCO2eq in SSP1-2.6 and would be able to approach net-zero in the SSP1-RE scenario given the possibility of collective effort for 100% renewable energy penetration with support from urban areas. The dataset is provided for 9 world regions across the three scenarios for each of the 420 urban areas.
